<h2>Machine Learning Projects</h2>
<h3>Large Language Model (LLM) Development Projects</h3>

- NTU Course Recommender Chatbot
  - Part of my undergrad Final Year Project
  - Conversational RAG chatbot that gives you information about NTU's undergraduate programmes. It can also provide you with programme recommendations based on your academic background, among other things.
  - Ollama, DeepSeek, Python, Hugging Face
  - Previously: Python, Hugging Face, LangChain, Llama, Mistral, Groq
- [Bobby the Chatbot](https://ntu-eee-dip-e028.web.app/chatbot)
  - This was for one of my uni modules, "Design Innovation Project". We built a web application, and I developed the chatbot for it.
  - Python, OpenAI SDK
- [AI Data Analyst Assistant](https://github.com/omar-ntu/data-analyst)
  - I developed an AI assistant that returns the user stock prices that they ask for. Comes with voice audio.
  - Did this for an internship application. Managed to impress the CTO with this during the interview and landed the internship.
  - Python, OpenAI SDK, Streamlit

<h3>Machine Learning Projects</h3>

- Recommendation System for NTU Aptitude-Based Admissions (ABA) applicants
  - Built a recommendation system that recommends appropriate schools in NTU to ABA applicants based on their interests, strengths, and academic background.
  - Collaborative Filtering using Probability Matrix Factorisation, Content-based Filtering via computing cosine similarity of BERT embeddings of user interests with school descriptions, Weighted Hybrid System of both filtering algorithms.
  - Tons of libraries (Pandas, Numpy, Hugging Face, NLTK, Matplotlib, ...)
- Information Extraction / Question-Answering Bot
  - Without using LLMs
  - Part of a project for my university module "Natural Language Processing".
  - Built a machine learning model that extracts key information from the lecture transcripts when given a user query (kinda like Google)
  - Experimented with different ways to do this, such as utilising a BERT-based NER model, a simple TF-IDF + cosine similarity, and finally fine-tuning BERT variants on the SQuAD dataset + our curated dataset
  - Conducted extensive hyperparameter tuning to achieve more than 90% accuracy of the model
- [Face Recognition](https://github.com/omar-ntu/face-recognition)
  - Part of my university module "Intelligent Systems Design".
  - Collaborated with 6 other EEE students to design and build face recognition systems using (1) traditional machine learning methods like Principal Component Analysis and (2) deep learning techniques like MTCNN
  - Python, OpenCV
- [Dogs vs Cats Classifier](https://github.com/omar-ntu/DogCatClassifier)
  - Part of my university module "Artificial Intelligence and Data Mining". Got a 'B+'.
  - I collaborate with 2 other EEE students to design and develop a convolutional neural network (CNN) that accurately classifies images of dogs and cats.
  - We performed some data augmentation techniques on the image dataset to expand it, and we conducted extensive hyperparameter tuning on the machine learning model to optimise its performance.
  - Python, PyTorch, NumPy
- [Handwritten Digit Recogniser Web Application](https://github.com/omar-ntu/digit_recognition_app)
  - I designed and constructed a convolutional neural network using Pytorch that can identify handwritten digits given by the user in this web application.
  - Python, PyTorch, Flask, HTML, CSS JavaScript
- [NTU Undergraduate Research Opportunity Programme (UROP)](https://github.com/omar-ntu/dummy-data-generation-and-data-augmentation-using-ML/tree/main)
  - I conducted a research project under my university's UROP. The title of my project is "Dummy Data Generation and Data Augmentation Using Machine Learning".
  - Python, PyTorch, NumPy, Matplotlib

<h2>Software Development Projects</h2>

- [Dental Clinic Website](https://github.com/koarine/Dental-Website-Project)
  - Part of my university module "Web Application Design". Got an 'A'.
  - I collaborate with a fellow EEE student to design and build a web application for a dental clinic that we call Radiant Smiles Dental.
  - HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, MySQL
- Web Application Design Case Study
  - Part of my university module "Web Application Design".
  - I collaborate with a fellow EEE student to architect and develop a web application according to a case study's requirements. The case study is about building a website for a coffee house. The project involves a webpage that allows the customer to submit orders, and webpages for the manager to update prices and get a sales report.
  - HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, MySQL

<h2>Machine Learning Projects</h2>
<h3>Large Language Model (LLM) Development Projects</h3>

- Lyon
  - Part of my undergrad Final Year Project
  - Conversational RAG chatbot that gives you information about NTU's undergraduate programmes. It can also provide you with programme recommendations based on your academic background, among other things.
  - Python, Hugging Face, LangChain, Llama, Mistral, Groq
- [Bobby the Chatbot](https://ntu-eee-dip-e028.web.app/chatbot)
  - This was for one of my uni modules, "Design Innovation Project". We built a web application, and I developed the chatbot for it.
  - Python, OpenAI SDK
- [AI Data Analyst Assistant](https://github.com/omar-ntu/data-analyst)
  - I developed an AI assistant that returns the user stock prices that they ask for. Comes with voice audio.
  - Python, OpenAI SDK, Streamlit
- [AI friend](https://github.com/omar-ntu/LLM-Deployment)
  - My first personal LLM project. I was getting an introduction to LLM development.
  - Python, Hugging Face, OpenAI SDK, Streamlit

<h3>Traditional ML Projects</h3>

- Dogs vs Cats Classifier
  - Part of my university module "Artificial Intelligence and Data Mining". The repository is currently private.
  - I collaborate with 2 other EEE students to design and develop a convolutional neural network (CNN) that accurately classifies images of dogs and cats.
  - We performed some data augmentation techniques on the image dataset to expand it, and we conducted extensive hyperparameter tuning on the machine learning model to optimise its performance.
  - Python, PyTorch, NumPy
- [Handwritten Digit Recogniser Web Application](https://github.com/omar-ntu/digit_recognition_app)
  - I designed and constructed a convolutional neural network using Pytorch that can identify handwritten digits given by the user in this web application.
  - Python, PyTorch, Flask, HTML, CSS JavaScript
- [NTU Undergraduate Research Opportunity Programme (UROP)](https://github.com/omar-ntu/dummy-data-generation-and-data-augmentation-using-ML/tree/main)
  - I conducted a research project under my university's UROP. The title of my project is "Dummy Data Generation and Data Augmentation Using Machine Learning".
  - Python, PyTorch, NumPy, Matplotlib
- [Working with Neural Networks](https://github.com/omar-ntu/Neural-Networks)
  - I explored and built numerous types of neural networks such as generative adversarial networks, neural style transfer, and convolutional neural networks to learn more about them.
  - Python, PyTorch

<h2>Software Development Projects</h2>

- [Dental Clinic Website](https://github.com/koarine/Dental-Website-Project)
  - Part of my university module "Web Application Design". Got an 'A'.
  - I collaborate with a fellow EEE student to design and build a web application for a dental clinic that we call Radiant Smiles Dental.
  - HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, MySQL
- Web Application Design Case Study
  - Part of my university module "Web Application Design". The repository is currently private.
  - I collaborate with a fellow EEE student to architect and develop a web application according to a case study's requirements. The case study is about building a website for a coffee house. The project involves a webpage that allows the customer to submit orders, and webpages for the manager to update prices and get a sales report.
  - HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, MySQL
